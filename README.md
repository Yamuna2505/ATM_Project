# ATM_Project
The project simulates the real-world operations of an ATM, including:
> Secure user authentication (Card Number + PIN)
> Balance inquiry 
> Deposits & Withdrawals 
> PIN changes 
> Mini statement with transaction history 

This project gave me hands-on experience with:
1.File handling using JSON
2.Object-Oriented Programming in Python
3.Real-life problem solving
4.Building a clean CLI-based user interface
